BDD
- The program receive two arguements,a hash and a pass_mark
- Hash(key of student names,value of marks obtained)
- Check whether the students passed or failed,group them
- Return a new hash with keys("failed" & "passed")
Pseudo-code
start
1.The program receive two arguements,a hash and a pass_mark
2.Iterate thru the hash checking whether values > pass_mark,
3.Use the group_by to check the values of the hash since it returns a new hash
4.Return a hash wuth keys "Failed" & "Passed"
5.Convert symbol keys to strings
end
=end

=begin
 def group_by_marks(marks, pass_marks)
     puts pass_marks
     marks.group_by{|k,v| v <= pass_marks ? "Failed" : "Passed"}
 end
=end
